Zotero wo Sansho suru!

## What is Zosan?
Zosan is a plugin to use Zotero.
Not for latex or MSword, but for Markdown.
This uses mustache tepmlate engine.
And make reference.

## Install and requirement
It depends on Denite, vim with python3, zotero, pystache
pystache is a package of python.
It can be installed by this command.

```
pip install pystache
```

## Usage

### Export Zotero Data
At first, export Zotero data.
Zotero data should be json.
There is a menu to export json file ;)

And then, put it in the directory your text file exists.

### Editing by Denite
Denite source can be used.

```
:Denite zosan
```

This inserts title-short tag of zotero.
Sometimes, there is a data without title-short.
Such data will be skipped.
Why do'nt you edit Zotero data which lacks section?

The tags are like this.
```

```

### Make Reference
Write reference template using Denite.
The command is this!

```
:Denite zosan-ref
```

The usage is same of mustache.
These are blocks.
Some blocks are converted because raw data is not readable.

- year {{year}}
- month {{month}}
- day {{day}}
  Day of publish of each reference.
- issued {{#issued}}\n\n{{/issued}}',

### Options
